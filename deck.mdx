> The web has everything we know on it, and you can read it all. _Nothing's stopping you_. Maybe the fact that that still blows my mind marks me as an old fogey, but honestly, how can that not?

‚Äî<cite>[@seldo](http://seldo.com/weblog/2013/09/04/why_i_am_a_web_developer), npm founder</cite>

Something _is_ stopping people.

Accessibility shouldn't be a special effort

```notes
Don't tag it on at the end
Part of the design process
```

---

Accessibility is a part of UX.

Design for diversity, not disability

---

Good design is inclusive

Inclusive design is good

---

## Accessibility is for everyone

It benefits more people than you might think.

---

### Permanent impairment

4.5% of the population are colour-blind (9% of men)

---

### Permanent impairment

10m people in the UK are disabled (~17% of the population)

Half are over state pension age

```notes
Aging population will increase this number
```

---

### Temporary or situational impairment

Everyone benefits from accessible design.

```notes

```

---

#### High contrast

user with poor vision
_or_
me reading my phone in bright sunlight üòé

---

#### Captioned videos

deaf user
_or_
me when I forget my headphones at work üéß

---

#### One-handed navigation

user with one arm
_or_
me drinking a beer üç∫

---

## Don't make assumptions

Not all users are like you or your teammates

---

Not everyone _always_ has great eyesight.

Not everyone _always_ has a powerful modern device.

Not everyone _always_ chooses the browser they use.

**Design for everyone.**

---

## How do we design accessibly?

---

### WCAG

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are a set of best practices.

To meet guidelines sites should be:

- **P**erceivable
- **O**perable
- **U**nderstandable
- **R**obust

```notes
also increasingly a legal requirement
```

---

### Cheatsheet

The guidelines can be quite dry, so here's a cheatsheet:

[bitsofco.de/the-accessibility-cheatsheet](https://bitsofco.de/the-accessibility-cheatsheet/)

---

#### Perceivable

Can all users perceive your UI?

e.g. text with sufficient size/contrast/line-height, images with alt-text, alerting screenreaders to dynamic content.

---

#### Operable

Can all users operate the UI components and navigation?

e.g. ensure keyboard functionality, no unnecessary time-limits, descriptive link text, hierarchical headings, unique & descriptive page titles.

---

#### Understandable

Can all your users understand the content and how to use the interface?

e.g. use plain English, set the `lang` attribute, label inputs, provide error messages in context.

---

#### Robust

Can your content be understood by different user-agents/assistive tech?

e.g. semantic HTML (and ARIA when this fails you), automated and manual testing.

---

## WAI-ARIA

_Web Accessibility Initiative ‚Äì Accessible Rich Internet Applications_...

A spec for assigning meaning to meaningless markup.

---

### ARIA gives divs superpowers

Useful where functionality is added with JS

Turns div-soup into something a screenreader can understand.

---

### Labels

Visually obvious content might need a text label.

e.g. `<button aria-label="toggle menu">‚ò∞</button>`

```notes
trigram for heaven
```

---

### Roles

Signifies your custom component as a type assistive tech can recognise.

e.g. a custom `<select>` using divs could use `role="listbox"`.

---

### Live regions

Ensures dynamically updated content is read out.

`aria-live="polite"` will be read once the current info finished

`aria-live="assertive"` will interrupt.

---

## How do we test accessibility?

---

### Manual testing

Actually use your UI!

Unplug your mouse. Try browser extensions that simulate visual conditions.

```notes
This is what I mean when I say a11y is design
Good designs account for all states and edge-cases
```

---

### Automated testing

Chrome Lighthouse, pa11y, aXe.

---

## Live coding time
